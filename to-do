TO-DO:

debian-dev:

    change alias files to point to mount-based dirs, ie:
      export MII_HOME=/thr_main/dev/
      export MII_WKSP=/thr_main/workspace

      THR: above done by adding $THR_ROOT to paths.  requires THR_ROOT defined in docker_compose or cmd line. 

    remove git completion stuff from bashrc

      THR: done.  dit remove git install though since it is required from build process.
